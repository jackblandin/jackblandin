### Problems with existing attempts

Existing attempts at planning for Multi Agent Environments (MAEs) is being undermined due to either

* the restrictive assumptions of the other agents' behavior
* the failure in accounting for their rationality
* the prohibitively expensive cost of modeling and predicting their intensions.

### Objective

Investigate how intention prediction can be efficiently exploited and made practical in planning, leading to efficient intention-awareplanning frameworks.

### Results

Performance losses from new planning policies are linearly bounded by the error of intention prediction. New policies achieve better and more robust performance than existing algorithms.
