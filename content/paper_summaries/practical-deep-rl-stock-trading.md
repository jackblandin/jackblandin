### Objective
Explore potential of Deep RL to maximize investment return.

### Strategy
Train DDPG agent and obtain an adaptive trading strategy (policy).

### Evaluation and Performance metrics
Compare Sharpe ratio and cumulative returns against Down Jones and traditional min-variance strategy.

### Conclusions
Conclusions | DDPG outperforms baselines in teroms of Sharpe ratio and cumulative returns.
